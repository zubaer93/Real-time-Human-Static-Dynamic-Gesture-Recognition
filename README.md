### Detecting cricket umpire’s gestures using logistic regression machine learning algorithm in real-time environment
Cricket is one of the most popular game in the Indian subcontinent. This sport is widely played in almost every continent. With the growing popularity of cricket, various aspect of the game is being automated with the advent of technology. Use of computer vision in case of taking third umpire decision is one of the most popular one. The most challenging issue on the game’s prosperity is its duration. The umpire gives his decision after each delivery. His decision is then interpreted in the scorecard. This is a tedious process. The traditional approaches considered so far involves wearing some kind of specialized hand gloves which collides with the beauty of the originality in the field. In this paper an approach is proposed and a prototype is implemented to automate the umpire’s decision by interpreting his hand gesture. The region of interest is selected using a Haar-cascade classifier and then the particular gesture is recognized using logistic regression. This process eliminates the manual updating of scorecards and reduce the game duration in a considerable manner. Besides, there is no need to wear any special gloves or sensors. The efficiency of the algorithm is then cross checked from the training and test data. This proved to be a very simple and efficient algorithm for umpire’s gesture detection. The average accuracy of our system is: for different people 76.67% and for different gesture 76.73%.
